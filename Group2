A simplified picture of a catalytic channel for surface reactions is show below. Reactants flow
in from the entry chamber on the left, and exit to the right. The channel walls are coated with a
catalyst so that reactions occur at surfaces, and the generated products are carried with the
flow into the exit chamber. 


The objective is to examine the flow of reaction products along the channel:
(a) Import the data file and plot filled contours of the concentration distribution. Provide all
labels and a colorbar, and ensure that your axes are ‘stretched’ to scale.
(b) Determine mean (along y) concentration <C> at each x point. From the principles of mass
transport, it can be shown that the mean concentration follows <C> = Ax**(1/2) . Based on this
information, perform a nonlinear fit to your <C> values and overlay the fit on top of your
data. Does the data follow the theoretical square root profile? What is the value of A here?
(c) Determine the gradient of the concentration in both x and y directions at each point.
(d) From mass transport calculations, it can be shown that the concentration ‘flux’ (amount of
product flowing per unit area per unit time) in the two directions at each point are:
